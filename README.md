# DeFi Dashboard
This is a DeFi dashboard that provides information on total value locked (TVL) in different chains, as well as data on different pools. The dashboard is built using Python, with libraries such as Requests, Pandas, Streamlit, Base64 and Plotly.

The code makes API requests to retrieve the TVL data for different chains and pool data, and then processes the data to extract the relevant information. The processed data is then displayed in a table, with the option to download the data as a CSV file. The TVL data is also visualized using a bar chart, showing the top 10 chains by TVL.

The dashboard also allows the user to filter the TVL data by chain, by selecting a chain from a drop-down list. The filtered data is then displayed in a table, with the option to download the filtered data as a CSV file.

Overall, this DeFi dashboard provides an easy-to-use interface for exploring DeFi data, making it a useful tool for anyone interested in the DeFi space.
